    "## 🎉 Workshop Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded a pre-trained language model (Qwen2-0.5B)\n",
    "2. ✅ Prepared custom training data for Axiomcart\n",
    "3. ✅ Tested the base model performance\n",
    "4. ✅ Configured LoRA for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "5. ✅ Fine-tuned the model on domain-specific data\n",
    "6. ✅ Compared base vs fine-tuned model performance\n",
    "7. ✅ Saved the fine-tuned model for future use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **LoRA** enables efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small fraction of parameters\n",
    "- **Domain-specific training** significantly improves model performance for specific use cases\n",
    "- **Proper data formatting** is crucial for successful fine-tuning\n",
    "- **Comparison testing** helps validate the effectiveness of fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Experiment with different LoRA configurations (r, alpha, dropout)\n",
    "- Try larger datasets or different domains\n",
    "- Explore evaluation metrics for more systematic comparison\n",
    "- Deploy the model as a customer service chatbot"
