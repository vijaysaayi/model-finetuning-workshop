Model Fine-tuning Validation Script
===================================

This script validates the fine-tuning process for creating a custom AI assistant for Axiomcart.
It loads a base model, fine-tunes it with custom data, and compares the performance.

Key Features:
- Uses Qwen2-0.5B as the base model
- Fine-tunes with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficiency
- Tests both base and fine-tuned models
- Reduced epochs for faster execution

Usage:
    python model_finetuning_validation.py
