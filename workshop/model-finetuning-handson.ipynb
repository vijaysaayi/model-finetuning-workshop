    "#### Understanding the Key Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's understand what each library does and why we need it:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Library | Purpose | Why We Need It |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| **torch** | PyTorch deep learning framework | Provides the foundation for tensor operations, neural network components, and GPU acceleration for training and inference |\n",
    "| **datasets.Dataset** | Hugging Face datasets library | Helps us create and manage training datasets in a format optimized for machine learning workflows |\n",
    "| **transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM** | Pre-trained model loader | Automatically loads pre-trained causal language models (like GPT-style models) that predict the next word in a sequence |\n",
    "| **transformers.AutoTokenizer** | Text tokenization | Handles converting text to numbers (tokens) that the model can understand and process |\n",
    "| **transformers.TrainingArguments** | Training configuration | Defines all training parameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. |\n",
    "| **trl.SFTTrainer** | Supervised fine-tuning trainer | Specialized trainer designed for instruction-following tasks with proper formatting and optimization |\n",
    "| **peft.LoraConfig** | LoRA configuration | Sets up Low-Rank Adaptation parameters for efficient fine-tuning |\n",
    "| **peft.get_peft_model** | PEFT model wrapper | Applies Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to existing models |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Fine-Tuning Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries work together in our fine-tuning pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **torch** → Provides the computational foundation\n",
    "2. **AutoTokenizer** → Converts text to model-readable format\n",
    "3. **AutoModelForCausalLM** → Loads our base language model\n",
    "4. **Dataset** → Organizes our training data efficiently\n",
    "5. **LoraConfig + get_peft_model** → Makes fine-tuning memory and compute efficient\n",
    "6. **TrainingArguments + SFTTrainer** → Manages the actual training process\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's import these libraries and start building our custom AI assistant!"
