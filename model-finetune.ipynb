      "Response: We're basically the Swiss Army knife of payment acceptance options - we're here to save the day and save you some time (because who doesn't love a bit of tech gurus!?). Our payment acceptance options are basically like the Swiss Army knife's knife that has all your favorite payment acceptance methods in a smorgasbord of options. Are there any payment acceptance methods we don't have? 🤦‍♀️ Oh no! We totally get it! 🤦‍♀️ Definately giving you the flexibility to choose the payment acceptance methods that work best for you - like having your favorite coffee delivery direct to your favorite coffee shop - or giving a loyalty program to your valued customers - who absolutely deserves all their perks! 📞✨ Axiomcart proudly accepts all major credit cards (the industry-standard 20% - 27% fees on plastic!), plus popular payment acceptance methods like PayPal, A2AX, and more! 📢 You can even choose to pay in real-time for your order - or maybe pay on your birthday - or maybe pay a bit more - who cares! 📝 Axiomcart's payment acceptance options are like a superpower - giving you the flexibility to save time and save your bank account! 🤦‍♀️ Axiomcart is the Swiss Army knife of payment acceptance options! ☕️\n",

    "## 🎉 Workshop Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded a pre-trained language model (Qwen2-0.5B)\n",
    "2. ✅ Prepared custom training data for Axiomcart\n",
    "3. ✅ Tested the base model performance\n",
    "4. ✅ Configured LoRA for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "5. ✅ Fine-tuned the model on domain-specific data\n",
    "6. ✅ Compared base vs fine-tuned model performance\n",
    "7. ✅ Saved the fine-tuned model for future use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **LoRA** enables efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small fraction of parameters\n",
    "- **Domain-specific training** significantly improves model performance for specific use cases\n",
    "- **Proper data formatting** is crucial for successful fine-tuning\n",
    "- **Comparison testing** helps validate the effectiveness of fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Experiment with different LoRA configurations (r, alpha, dropout)\n",
    "- Try larger datasets or different domains\n",
    "- Explore evaluation metrics for more systematic comparison\n",
    "- Deploy the model as a customer service chatbot"
